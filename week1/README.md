# Week 1

Welcome to Automation for Robotics Automation using ROS!

The first week has three main goals -
1) Setting up a proper development environment for working with ROS. 
2) Learning the basics of python. 
3) Getting familiar with the tools you will need for the course. 

If you face any difficulty in completing the following tasks, please feel free to contact the team.

### Setting up your development environemt
Detailed instructions regarding what software you will need and how to go about installing it are given in Preparing your Development Environment.pdf

### Basic Python
Python is an essential tool in Robotics. Its ease of use and flexibility makes it perfect for rapid prototyping. Nearly all of the code in this course will be written in Python.

In the first week you should aim to understand the following fundamental concepts. They are what you will be using 90% of the time while programming  -
1. Data Types
2. Operators
3. Control Flow (Branching and Looping)
4. Functions

Here are a learning resources to get you started. Apart from these the internet has an abundance of python tutorials.

- *Bytes of Python* is included in this repo (and can also be found [here](https://python.swaroopch.com/)) . Till Chapter 1.10 *Functions* is recommended.
- *Intro to Computer Science* course on edX which can be found [here](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science). The first three weeks are recommended.
- Sentdex's [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXBD2bB9-RA&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeAams7fkdcwOGBpGdHpXln) on python.
- A few example ipython notebooks: [1](https://github.com/SforAiDl/Deep-Learning-TIP/blob/master/Week_1/lesson1_part_1.ipynb), [2](https://github.com/SforAiDl/Deep-Learning-TIP/blob/master/Week_1/lesson1_part_2.ipynb), [3](https://github.com/SforAiDl/Deep-Learning-TIP/blob/master/Week_1/Lesson_2_numpy.ipynb) (credits [SAiDL](https://github.com/SforAiDl/)) 


### Tools
Any kind of software development has a large ecosystem of tools built to make the task of programming as easy as possible. 

1. **Git**: Fundamental tool in open source software development, it is used for version control and sharing of code. You are required to maintain a personal repository containing all your work related to the course and project. For complete beginners, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc) video is a nice starting point. [This](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) is a cool guide for a quick overview. For a more detailed introduction check out this [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123) by Udacity or the official GitHub [guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/).

2. **Linux Terminal**: A terminal is a text based prompt which is used by the user to interact with the operating system of a computer. Many of the tools we will be using inluding ROS are terminal based so it is necessary to have at least some idea of how to use it. [This](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS1QulWo1RIb9WVQGJ_vh-RQusbZgO_As) video series is a really nice guide. For those of you who are completely new to the terminal, we recommend going through the first 20 videos (dont worry, they are short videos and the subject matter is not at all difficult) of the series. 


### Robotics Operating System (ROS)
ROS is an extensive framework of  tools which can be used to build software to power robots with. We will be learning about it in much more detail next week. However to get an idea for what it is and why it exists you can check out these two short videos ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL1_Ue4rUWs), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qkm8VtdOds4))
